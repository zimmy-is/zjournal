                <h4 class=weekTitle>Week One: Basics of Javascript</h4>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p class="blurb">So it begins! The course started with some Javascript fundamentals. I got to grips with
                    VS
                    code, learing
                    how to navigate the program, interact with the terminal and created my first .js file. I enjoyed
                    dabbling in the terminal, it took me right back to my childhood days of experimenting in DOS.
                    By the end of the first week I could already see the limitless potential of coding, which started
                    the
                    creative cogs whirring. I made a few little programs of my own to practice, and applied what I'd
                    learned
                    so far. I especially enjoyed creating a simple RPG character rolling program, incorperating what I'd
                    learned about random number generation and iterative loops.</p>
                <h4>Topics Covered:</h4>
                <div class="blurb">
                    <p><b>Dot Notation:</b> I learned what dot notation is, and how to use it</p>
                    <p><b>Variable operators:</b> I had a basic understanding of variable operators from playing with
                        C++
                        previously,
                        but it was great to have this clarified and crystalised into my brain.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>ifElse:</b> Again I vaguely understood the fundamentals already, but now I really get it.</p>
